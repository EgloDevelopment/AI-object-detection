# AI-object-detection

A Python test to detect objects.

# Installation

First run

```
pip install imageAI
pip install opencv-python
pip install Pillow
pip install numpy


(Please do not that there are too many librarys to track, so you are going to need to install more, sorry :p )
```

You then need to install the ```.h5``` file for the detection to work, go to ```https://drive.google.com/file/d/16Wi6NWCAYXA9Zqnrv0-NB6RblW-8gNkW/view?usp=sharing``` to download the file.

Then you need to add the ```yolo.h5``` file to the directory with your files.

Then all you should need to do is run the script and it should work.
